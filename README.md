A brief
introduction to
trend signals
Trend signals are used in traditional, alternative and digital assets investment
management as a way to pursue uncorrelated returns.
The simple, but powerful, idea
behind trend strategies is that markets respond slowly to news and sea changes.
Trend investors seek to harvest returns by "riding" an uptrend or a downtrend as the
market adapts.
Trend, also referred to as time series momentum, is well documented
in academic literature and practiced in quantitative finance and in the CTA community
in long-only and long/short implementations.
How to create a
trend signal
Identifying an up- or downtrend entails comparing recent prices to older prices over a
recent historical period (the "lookback window").
If recent prices are higher, an uptrend
might be indicated;
if recent prices are lower, a downtrend may be in place.
A trend
strategy uses that signal to position long or short in expectation that the up or down
trend will persist.
The choice of lookback window (or, better yet, multiple windows) can
impact the predictive qualities of the trend signal.
The best choice can vary depending
on the asset class.
How the Bitcoin
Trend Indicator
works
The Bitcoin Trend Indicator uses four different lookback windows chosen with the
24/7 trading cycle of crypto assets in mind.
Each day, a trend value is calculated from
each lookback window by comparing recent prices to older prices within the window.
A "1" indicates rising prices in the lookback and a "-1" indicates falling prices.
The Bitcoin
Trend Indicator is the average of these values for the four lookback windows:

Historical
performance
We back-tested the Bitcoin Trend Indicator over a five-year historical period, using the
CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX).
The value of the Bitcoin Trend Indicator is shown
in the color of the time series line.
We can make the general observation that the Bitcoin
Trend Indicator has been historically successful at identifying the majority of long-term
uptrends and downtrends in the price of bitcoin.

A hypothetical
long-only
implementation
We now use the Bitcoin Trend Indicator to implement a hypothetical long-only strategy
that allocates between bitcoin and a risk-free asset ("cash").
The objective of this
strategy is to maintain exposure to bitcoin proportionate to the strength of the Bitcoin
Trend Indicator, varying from 100% bitcoin to 100% cash.
We can observe that the
portfolio of bitcoin and cash, as informed by the Bitcoin Trend Indicator has reduced
drawdowns during "crypto winters" while still participating in price uptrends.

A widely-used technique known as Moving Average Crossovers
Recent short-term price averages are compared to recent long-term price averages
If the short-term average is greater than the long-term average, the asset is
considered to be in an uptrend
Uses four crossover windows, ranging from very short term (2-day vs 10-day) to
medium term (20-day vs 80-day)

Introduction
Objective
The Trend Indicator family is a set of dynamic signals designed to convey the presence,
direction, and strength of momentum in the price of a digital asset.
Each trend indicator
is calculated and published daily derived from historical daily levels of the underlying
reference price index ("Underlying Index") for each digital asset as detailed in Table 1.
Table 1: Trend Indicators

"
"Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI)
","CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX)
","2
"
"Ether Trend Indicator (ETI)
","CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX)
","2
"

Each Trend Indicator will have one of five possible daily values, with each value
corresponding to an indicated direction and strength of trend in the price of the
underlying digital asset as shown in Table 2.

Highlights
The family of Trend Indicators was created by CoinDesk Indices ("CDI") and launched in
March 2023.
This methodology was created by CDI to achieve the above-stated objective.
There
may be circumstances or market events that require CDI, in its sole discretion, to
deviate from or amend these rules to ensure each Trend Indicator continues to meet the
Objective.

\--- PAGE 10 ---

Input data
For each Trend Indicator, the historical time series for the Underlying Index is the sole
input data for the calculation of each Trend Indicator.
Calculation
Daily reference prices
The historical time series used to calculate each Trend Indicator is the value of each
Underlying Index at 4 p.m.
Eastern Time¹. The 180 most recent observations, up to and
including the current day, are used in the calculation.
Each underlying index value is
rounded to the decimal precision detailed in Table 1.
Calculation methodology
Overview
The calculation of each Trend Indicator is an average of four component inputs.
Each
component input is the result of comparing a shorter-term and a longer-term moving
average of the level of its Underlying Index.
When the shorter-term moving average is
greater than or equal to (less than) the corresponding longer-term moving average, the
component's input value is set to +1 (-1), indicating an uptrend (downtrend).
The possible values of each Trend Indicator detailed in Table 2 above represent the
range of possible values of averaging the four component inputs.
Moving average crossover pairs
The four component inputs used in the calculation of each Trend Indicator are derived
by comparing the moving average pairs detailed in Table 2, with each moving average
expressed as a half-life2 in days.

1 The 4 p.m. Eastern Time values reflect the last calculated value of the Underlying Index prior to 4 p.m.
Eastern Time.
2 Each moving average period is defined as a half-life rather than a complete lookback window.
The
Trend Indicators use exponentially decaying weights to measure moving averages.
A half-life is the
period by which one half of the weight of the average has been recognized.
Trend Indicator Methodology

\--- PAGE 11 ---

Exponentially weighted moving averages
Moving averages are exponentially weighted using a fixed window of 180 observations.
Moving average windows are calculated using a Decay Factor (λ) that sets the half-life
of the exponentially weighted moving average equal to the corresponding half-life
shown in Table 3. A Normalization Factor (NF) is also calculated and included to correct
for the residual averaging weight beyond 180 observations³.
Both are shown in Table 4.

Trend Indicator Calculation
For each day t, the Trend Indicator is calculated as follows:
where,
and
$Tl_{t}=\frac{(MAP_{1,t}+MAP_{2,t}+MAP_{3,t}+MAP_{4,t})}{4}$
$MAP_{1,t}=SIGN(MA_{1,t}-MA_{5,t})$
$MAP_{2,t}=SIGN(MA_{2.5,t}-MA_{10,t})$
$MAP_{3,t}=SIGN(MA_{5,t}-MA_{20,t})$
$MAP_{4,t}=SIGN(MA_{10,t}-MA_{40,t})$
$SIGN(x)=IF(x\ge0,1,-1)$
3 Since the methodology uses a fixed 180-day window with exponentially declining weights, the total
weights over 180-days add up to slightly less than zero.
To correct for this, the weights are normalized by
dividing 1 by the sum of the weights over 180 days.
This normalization factor is negligible for the shorter
half-lives and more substantial for the longer half-lives.
Trend Indicator Methodology

\--- PAGE 12 ---

And, for each half-life (h),
$MA_{h,t}=\sum_{t=0}^{179}(1-\lambda_{h}){\lambda_{h}}^{i}\times NF_{h}\times UI_{t-i}$
where h represents each moving average half-life, represents the corresponding
Decay Factor, and NF represents the corresponding Normalization Factor, all as shown
in Table 4, and Ul represents the Reference Price, i.e., the level of the Underlying Index
at 4 p.m.
Eastern Time on the day indicated.
Calculation time
The calculation will take place each day at approximately 16:10 Eastern Time, or as
soon as is practical thereafter.
Data distribution
Following the calculation, the daily trend indicator values will be available through a
CoinDesk API. Please contact info@coindesk-indices.com for details.
Please see Table 5 for launch dates and historical data availability for each Trend
Indicator.

Data availability
If all inputs are available prior to calculation, each Trend Indicator will be calculated and
published.
In the event an input required for the calculation of one or more Trend
Indicators is not available at the time of publication, the publication of the impacted
Trend Indicator will be delayed until all required data are available.

Governance
Each Trend Indicator is governed by the Systematic Signals Committee (the
"Committee").
The Committee provides ongoing oversight of the signals and the Trend
Indicator methodology (the "Methodology").
The Committee meets on a periodic basis
and is primarily responsible for the following functions:

1.  Ownership, maintenance, and regular reviews of the Methodology.
2.  Review and approval of material changes to the Methodology.
3.  Determine the impact of market events on the application of the Methodology.
4.  Use of Discretion during the application of the Methodology.
5.  Mitigate conflicts of interest by ensuring decisions and announcements are
    aligned with the Methodology and internal procedures.
